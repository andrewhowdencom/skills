# Project Template

This repository is a template for new software projects, designed to guide AI software engineers (agents) through a structured, documentation-driven development process.

## AGENTS.md

The `AGENTS.md` file is the primary entry point for an agent. It acts as a conditional router, directing the agent to the appropriate documentation in the `/docs/development/` directory based on the task at hand. This ensures that the agent follows the project's established conventions and best practices.

## Documentation

The documentation in `/docs/development/` is structured according to the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/), which categorizes content into four types:

*   **Tutorials:** Learning-oriented guides to help the agent get started.
*   **How-to guides:** Goal-oriented steps to solve specific problems.
*   **Reference:** Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
*   **Explanation:** Understanding-oriented discussions of concepts and background.

This structure provides a clear and comprehensive resource for the agent, enabling it to work efficiently and effectively.
