# Development

This repository serves as a template for new projects. Developing in this repository primarily involves updating the documentation and guidelines that agents follow.

## Structure

The documentation is organized according to the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/) in the `docs/development/` directory:

*   `tutorials/`: Learning-oriented guides.
*   `how-to/`: Goal-oriented guides.
*   `reference/`: Technical descriptions.
*   `explanation/`: Understanding-oriented discussions.

## Making Changes

1.  **Identify the type of documentation:** Determine if your change is a tutorial, how-to, reference, or explanation.
2.  **Locate the file:** Find the appropriate file in `docs/development/` or create a new one.
3.  **Edit:** Make your changes using Markdown.
4.  **Update AGENTS.md:** If you added a new topic, ensure `AGENTS.md` is updated to route agents to the new documentation.

## Guidelines

*   Keep instructions clear and concise.
*   Use standard Markdown formatting.
*   Ensure all links are relative and working.
