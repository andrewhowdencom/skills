# Development

This repository serves as a template for new projects. Developing in this repository primarily involves updating the **skills** that agents follow.

## Structure

The configuration is organized into "Skills" in the `skills/` directory, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

*   `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: The primary entry point for the skill, containing instructions and context.
*   `skills/<name>/references/`: Detailed documentation, templates, and reference material for the skill.

## Making Changes

1.  **Identify the skill:** Determine which skill your change relates to (e.g., `git`, `architecture`).
2.  **Locate the file:** Find the `SKILL.md` or a file in `references/` within that skill's directory.
3.  **Edit:** Make your changes using Markdown.
4.  **Create new skills:** If the topic doesn't exist, create a new directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file.

## Guidelines

*   Keep instructions in `SKILL.md` clear and concise.
*   Use standard Markdown formatting.
