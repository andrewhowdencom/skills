# Documentation

## Maintenance
Review `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and other files in `docs/` just before committing to ensure they match the latest program state.

## libraries
For external libraries:
- **README.md**: Required at root. Must include Introduction, Installation, Examples (runnable), and API Reference.
- **Examples**: Must be self-contained, runnable, and cover common use cases.
