# Tests

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Develop via "test driven design" for almost all changes:
1.  **Write tests** for current behavior.
2.  **Modify tests** to verify new desired behavior.
3.  **Modify logic** until it validates against tests.
4.  **Refactor** application or tests until passing.
5.  **Publish**.
